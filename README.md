# 310ProjectOneNewRepo
IMPORTANT NOTE:
I changed repositories on the last day because of some package/build path issues. I have been committing to 
that repository (https://github.com/sraguraman/310ProjectOne) for the vast majority of development. 
Please grade THIS REPO instead of that one. 

To Compile:
1) Enter the bin file.
2) Ensure the inputfile.txt exists in the bin file.
3) Command: java projectone.SearchFile inputfile.txt output.txt 

--> The output is entirely correct but the formatting is off. All paths and corresponding costs exist.
If you match the two columns, the paths and corresponding costs will match exactly.

For ANT compilation:
1) Enter 310ProjectOne (this is where build.xml exists)
2) Run all ANT commands.
